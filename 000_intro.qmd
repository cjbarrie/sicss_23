git --version 
```

## Workflow

::: incremental
1.  We all need to create a Github account.

2.  We get our computer talking to Git by logging our Github credentials (either SSH or HTTPS approach)

3.  We create a Github Repo

4.  We create an R "Project"

5.  We start writing our code

6.  We "commit" and then "push" our changes when ready
:::

## Setting up in R

-   Create a personal access token

```{r, eval = F}
install.packages("usethis") #if you haven't already installed
library(usethis)

usethis::create_github_token()

gitcreds::gitcreds_set()

```

## .gitignore

-   Where you can specify what to remove from the version control

## Committing and pushing

-   "Commit" - a mark in the sand to where you might want to return
-   "Push" - publishing to source repo to save as current version

## Ethics

-   consequentialism
-   deontology

## How do we decide?

-   IRB (rules-based)
-   ethical judgment (principles-based)

...

-   and we do this *openly* (transparency-based accountability)

## Ethics

-   respect for persons
-   beneficence
-   justice
-   respect for law and public interest

## Ethics

-   respect for persons (Belmont)
-   beneficence (Belmont)
-   justice (Belmont)
-   respect for law and public interest (Menlo)

3.  <https://aoir.org/reports/ethics3.pdf>

## Ethics

-   respect for persons
    -   participants decide--not you (informed consent)

## Ethics

-   beneficence
    -   minimize risk and maximiize benefits to decide if worth it

    -   N.B. third-party oversight (because researcher bias)

## Ethics

-   justice

    -   distribution of benefits and burdens of research

        -   vulnerable individuals; global South as lab

## Ethics

-   respect for law and public interest

    -   compliance (TOS and general law...)
        -   N.B. difficulties with cross-national research
    -   be open about what you're doing (transparency-based accountability)

## Group work

-   Split into five groups
-   Each of you assigned one reading

    -   <https://www.dropbox.com/s/883j32og8zcx0ew/Mexico%20Saturation%20Intervention%20v12.pdf?dl=0>
-   Think about the study as it relates to: respect for persons; beneficence; justice; respect for law and public interest
