<section id="worksheet-using-apis" class="level1 unnumbered">
<h1 class="unnumbered">Worksheet: Using APIs</h1>
<p>For this worksheet, we will go through how to set up an experiment with the YouTube Recommendation algorithm.</p>
<p>This will partially replicate the technique used in the article by <span class="citation" data-cites="haroon2022">@haroon2022</span>.</p>
<section id="using-the-youtube-api" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="using-the-youtube-api">Using the YouTube API</h2>
<p>In order to use the YouTube API, we’ll first need to get our authorization token. These can be obtained by anybody, with or without an academic profile (i.e., unlike <code>academictwitteR</code>) in previous worksheets.</p>
<p>In order to get you authorization credentials, you can follow this <a href="https://developers.google.com/youtube/v3/getting-started">guide</a>. You will need to have an account on the Google Cloud console in order to do this. The main three steps are to:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>create a “Project” on the Google Cloud console;</li>
<li>to associate the YouTube API with this Project;</li>
<li>to enable the API keys for the API</li>
</ol>
<p>Once you have created a Project (here: called “tuberalt1” in my case) you will see a landing screen like this.</p>
<p><img src="images/Screenshot%202022-10-31%20at%2014.59.25.png" class="img-fluid"></p>
<p>We can then get our credentials by navigating to the menu on the left hand side and selecting credentials:</p>
<p><img src="images/Screenshot%202022-10-31%20at%2014.59.41.png" class="img-fluid"></p>
<p>We have two pieces of information stored here that we will need. These are our “client ID” and “API key”. The client ID is referred to below as our “app ID” in the <code>tuber</code> packaage and the Client Secret shown below is our “app secret” in the <code>tuber</code> package.</p>
<p><img src="images/Screenshot%202023-06-11%20at%2011.37.39.png" class="img-fluid"></p>
<p><img src="images/Screenshot%202023-06-11%20at%2011.45.06.png" class="img-fluid"></p>
<p>Once we have our credentials, we can log them in our R environment with the <code>yt_oauth</code> function in the <code>tuber</code> package. This function takes two arguments: an “app ID” and an “app secret”. Both of these will be provided to you once you have associated the YouTube API with your Google Cloud console project.</p>
</section>
<section id="getting-youtube-data" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="getting-youtube-data">Getting YouTube data</h2>
<p>In the paper by <span class="citation" data-cites="haroon2022">@haroon2022</span>, the authors analyze the recommended videos for a particular used based on their watch history and on a seed video. In the below, we won’t replicate the first step but we will look at the recommended videos that appear based on a seed video.</p>
<p>In this case, our seed video is a video by Jordan Peterson predicting the death of mainstream media. This is fairly “alternative” content and is actively taking a stance against mainstream media. So does this mean YouTube will learn to recommend us <em>away</em> from mainstream content?</p>

</div>
<p>In the above, we first take the unique identifying code string for the video. You can find this in the url for the video as shown below.</p>
<p><img src="images/Screenshot%202022-10-31%20at%2015.16.19.png" class="img-fluid"></p>
<p>We can then collect the videos recommended on the basis of having this video as the seed video. We store these as the data.frame object <code>rel_vids</code>.</p>
<p>And we can have a look at the recommended videos on the basis of this seed video below.</p>

Peterson is a professor of psychology at the University of Toronto, a clinical psychologist and the author of the multi-million copy bestseller 12 Rules for Life: An Antidote to Chaos, #1 for nonfiction in 2018 in the US, Canada, the UK, Australia, New Zealand, Sweden, the Netherlands, Brazil and Norway, and slated for translation into 50 languages.\\n\\nJordan Peterson's a clinical psychologist and professor of psychology at the University of Toronto. He authored Maps of Meaning: The Architecture of Belief in 1999. He worked as an associate professor in the psychology department at Harvard University.\\n\\nAccording to Peterson, he learned to read at the age of 3, and attended the United Church of Canada with his family. After graduating from Fairview High School in 1979, Peterson entered the Grande Prairie Regional College to study political science. He later transferred to the University of Alberta, where he completed his B.A. in 1982. In 1985, he moved to Montreal to attend McGill University. He earned his Ph.D. in clinical psychology under the supervision of Robert O. Pihl and Maurice Dongier in 1991. Peterson lived in Massachusetts, while teaching and conducting research at Harvard University as an assistant and an associate professor in the psychology department. During his time at Harvard, he studied aggression arising from drug and alcohol abuse, and supervised a number of unconventional thesis proposals. In 2004, a 13-part TV series based on his book Maps of Meaning: The Architecture of Belief aired on TVOntario. He has also appeared on TVO on shows such as Big Ideas. Peterson was nominated for the position of Rector of the University of Glasgow in March 2017. \\n\\n►Video footage:  All video footage is licensed under CC-BY 3.0 or licensed from stock footage websites. \\n\\n►Music licensed through https://artlist.io/\\n\\nHowever, if any content owners would like their images removed, please contact us by email at chirea.catalin95@gmail.com\\n\\nSpeaker: \\n\\n\\nJordan Peterson\\n\\n// LINKS //\\nWebsite: https://jordanbpeterson.com\\nEvents: https://jordanbpeterson.com/events\\nBlog: https://jordanbpeterson.com/blog\\nPodcast: https://jordanbpeterson.com/podcast\\n\\n// SOCIAL //\\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/jordanbpeterson\\nInstagram: https://instagram.com/jordan.b.peterson\\nFacebook: https://facebook.com/drjordanpeterson\\nYoutube: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCL_f53ZEJxp8TtlOkHwMV9Q","7":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/U80_D4ts_aE/default.jpg","8":"120","9":"90","10":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/U80_D4ts_aE/mqdefault.jpg","11":"320","12":"180","13":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/U80_D4ts_aE/hqdefault.jpg","14":"480","15":"360","16":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/U80_D4ts_aE/sddefault.jpg","17":"640","18":"480","19":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/U80_D4ts_aE/maxresdefault.jpg","20":"1280","21":"720","22":"Grow Successful","23":"none","24":"2021-11-29T12:51:58Z"},{"1":"1Gp7xNnW5n8","2":"YYCnOnZ7zyI","3":"2021-01-07T15:40:22Z","4":"UCKsP3v2JeT2hWI_HzkxWiMA","5":"\"This KEEPS 99% of People Single!\" - FIX THIS TO FIND LOVE| Joe Dispenza","6":"Download podcast episodes a week early! http://www.lewishowes.com/pod\\nVisit Dr. Joe Dispenza's site here - https://drjoedispenza.com/\\n\\nDr. Joe Dispenza is an international speaker, researcher, author, and educator who is passionate about the findings from the fields of neuroscience, epigenetics, and quantum physics to explore the science behind spontaneous remissions. He uses that knowledge to help people heal themselves of illness, chronic conditions, and even terminal diseases so they can enjoy a more fulfilled and happy life as well as evolve their consciousness.\\n\\nDr. Joe is the New York Times bestselling author of You Are the Placebo: Making Your Mind Matter, which explores our ability to heal without drugs or surgery, but rather by thought alone. His most recent book, Becoming Supernatural, talks about how we can intentionally change our brain chemistry to initiate profoundly mystical, transcendental experiences and develop a more healthy body, mind, and spiritual life.\\n\\nDr. Joe didn’t always work in the field of neuroscience. He started out as a chiropractor, earning his doctor of chiropractic degree from Life University in Atlanta, GA. He had a successful chiropractic practice, but one day he had a dangerous accident. In 1986, while cycling in a triathlon, Dr. Joe was hit by a truck. He broke six vertebrae in his spine, and his doctors told him he would never walk again.\\n\\nDr. Joe asked four different surgeons what he should do, and all four of them prescribed a complicated surgery. The surgery would relieve some of his pain but nearly guarantee he would never walk again. But that wasn’t good enough. He refused to have the surgery and instead began to imagine himself totally healed. He visualized each vertebrae healing and reconstructed his spine in his mind. In just ten and a half weeks, Dr. Joe was back on his feet, and in twelve weeks, he was training again and back at work at his chiropractic clinic. He fully healed himself with just his mind.\\n\\nI’ve had Dr. Joe a couple of times on the podcast now (Episode 826 and Episode 679), and in the past, we’ve talked about unlocking the power of the mind and breaking the addiction of negative thoughts. But in today’s episode, I wanted to change it up and ask Dr. Joe about relationships. Our conversation blew me away so much that I had to split this interview up into two parts, so stay tuned for the second part on Wednesday!\\n\\nBut for now, join me on Episode 1,054 to learn about how to transform your mind for lasting love and magnetic relationships with the incredible Dr. Joe Dispenza!","7":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/YYCnOnZ7zyI/default.jpg","8":"120","9":"90","10":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/YYCnOnZ7zyI/mqdefault.jpg","11":"320","12":"180","13":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/YYCnOnZ7zyI/hqdefault.jpg","14":"480","15":"360","16":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/YYCnOnZ7zyI/sddefault.jpg","17":"640","18":"480","19":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/YYCnOnZ7zyI/maxresdefault.jpg","20":"1280","21":"720","22":"Lewis Howes","23":"none","24":"2021-01-07T15:40:22Z"},{"1":"1Gp7xNnW5n8","2":"dB7d89-YHjM","3":"2020-03-02T13:52:14Z","4":"UCYeF244yNGuFefuFKqxIAXw","5":"What Happened At The Beginning Of Time? - with Dan Hooper","6":"We’re learning more and more about the recent history of our universe, but how much do we really know about its very first few seconds?\\nDan’s book \"At The Edge Of Time\" is available now - https://geni.us/noTSA\\n\\nWatch the Q&A: https://youtu.be/Vjkj0m9YgcA\\n\\nEver since Edwin Hubble observed that the universe was expanding in 1929, cosmologists have had their work cut out for them trying to solve the seemingly impossible questions arising from the time immediately after the Big Bang.\\n\\nIn this talk Dan Hooper explores the perplexing problems surrounding the secrets of the early universe, and the far-reaching implications some of the answers might have for the understanding of the universe we think we have today.\\n\\nDan Hooper is Senior Scientist and the Head of the Theoretical Astrophysics Group at the Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory.

Joyce | #287","6":"Dr. Peterson's extensive catalog is available now on DailyWire+: https://utm.io/ueSXh\\n\\nThe Trans movement surges across western civilization, necessitating the ego-centric fantasies of gender-dysphoric youths over what once was known commonly as indisputable reality. Helen Joyce and Dr Jordan B Peterson discuss the depths of this truly cultural battle, the dangers of a quickly growing transhumanist ideology, and the unbridled narcissism lurking at the heart of the conflict.\\n\\nHelen Joyce is an Irish novelist and journalist, acting as the executive editor for events and business at the Economist in London. Before this, she trained as a mathematician, graduating from the Trinity College in Dublin, before attending Cambridge. She then acquired a PHD in geometric measure theory at the University College London. She has held many roles as a journalist, working for PLUS Magazine and Significance Magazine, both of which have an emphasis on communicating complex math and statistics to the everyday reader. Later, she would spend three years as the Economist’s foreign correspondent to Brazil, living in São Paulo. In 2018, Joyce curated a series of articles on transgender identity, which lead her to author the Sunday Times bestselling book, “Trans: When Ideology Meets Reality.”\\n\\n—Links— \\n\\nFor Helen Joyce:\\n\\nHelen Joyce’s Website & Newsletter “Joyce Activated” - thehelenjoyce.com\\n\\nHelen Joyce’s Sunday Times Best Selling Book “Trans” - https://www.amazon.com/Trans-Sunday-Bestseller-Helen-Joyce/dp/0861543726/ref=sr_1_1?crid=2L25DMQRFMT6N&keywords=helen+joyce+trans&qid=1662808186&sprefix=helen+joyce+trans%2Caps%2C157&sr=8-1 \\n\\nHelen Joyce is the Director of Advocacy for - https://sex-matters.org/ \\n\\n—Chapters—\\n\\n(0:00) - Coming Up\\n(0:57) - Intro\\n(2:22) - Writing “Trans”\\n(9:46) - Women and Biological Reality\\n(19:50) - Age Solidarity Among Women\\n(24:57) - Narcissism, a Key Contributor\\n(34:53) - Fetishes & the Unbalanced Psyche\\n(36:57) - Breaking the Fantasy\\n(42:25) - Freud & the Oedipal Complex\\n(48:11) - Context Defines Your Identity\\n(55:45) - Transhumanist “Meat Lego”\\n(59:40) - The Depth of the Battle, the Death of God\\n(1:05:54) - Lying to Children, Ellen Page\\n(1:10:27) - The Social Pillory\\n\\n// SUPPORT THIS CHANNEL //\\nNewsletter: https://mailchi.mp/jordanbpeterson.com/youtubesignup\\nDonations: https://jordanbpeterson.com/donate\\n\\n// COURSES //\\nDiscovering Personality: https://jordanbpeterson.com/personality\\nSelf Authoring Suite: https://selfauthoring.com\\nUnderstand Myself (personality test): https://understandmyself.com\\n\\n// BOOKS //\\nBeyond Order: 12 More Rules for Life: https://jordanbpeterson.com/Beyond-Order\\n12 Rules for Life: An Antidote to Chaos: https://jordanbpeterson.com/12-rules-for-life\\nMaps of Meaning: The Architecture of Belief: https://jordanbpeterson.com/maps-of-meaning\\n\\n// LINKS //\\nWebsite: https://jordanbpeterson.com\\nEvents: https://jordanbpeterson.com/events\\nBlog: https://jordanbpeterson.com/blog\\nPodcast: https://jordanbpeterson.com/podcast\\n\\n// SOCIAL //\\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/jordanbpeterson\\nInstagram: https://instagram.com/jordan.b.peterson\\nFacebook: https://facebook.com/drjordanpeterson\\nTelegram: https://t.me/DrJordanPeterson\\nAll socials: https://linktr.ee/drjordanbpeterson\\n\\n#JordanPeterson #JordanBPeterson #DrJordanPeterson #DrJordanBPeterson #DailyWirePlus #podcast #narcissism #socialmedia #identitypolitics #helenjoyce #transgenderism #genderidentity","7":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/mDJ65ortiLo/default.jpg","8":"120","9":"90","10":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/mDJ65ortiLo/mqdefault.jpg","11":"320","12":"180","13":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/mDJ65ortiLo/hqdefault.jpg","14":"480","15":"360","16":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/mDJ65ortiLo/sddefault.jpg","17":"640","18":"480","19":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/mDJ65ortiLo/maxresdefault.jpg","20":"1280","21":"720","22":"Jordan B Peterson","23":"none","24":"2022-09-12T14:38:09Z"},{"1":"1Gp7xNnW5n8","2":"ntLyha0fy7k","3":"2022-01-03T19:51:48Z","4":"UCevXpeL8cNyAnww-NqJ4m2w","5":"Mainstream Media Is Dead!","6":"Youtube is mainstream media.

The outcry for new material from Jordan’s catalog of books, lectures, and podcasts has been overwhelming. \\n[04:00] Espousing the profundity of Eric Neumann’s works in his “The Origins and History of Consciousness and The Great Mother.”\\n[05:20] Peterson comments on another personal favorite author of his, Mircea Eliade, and his history of religious ideas - an anthropological and sociological assessment of religion that’s also deeply psychological.\\n[06:40] How Russians respond to Jordan's affinity for Alexander Solzhenitsyn. Mikail details the feelings of the Russian people by their portrayal after the fall of communism.\\n[10:00] How we deal with the guilt of the things our ancestors or society have done: a very difficult question because we are very historical creatures. The best thing for us is to try to understand what happened and avoid making the same mistakes twice.\\n[13:30] Examining the trope that all white people are racist; the existential guilt of history.\\n[20:00] Richard Dawkins, Sam Harris, and Daniel Dennett seem to hold that religious belief is a set of propositions about the material world (in a way a direct competitor to scientific theory) and that’s just not fully accurate. There is something outside of strict rationality in the human experience.\\n[24:00] Gibson’s visual perception theory. Value is the key to our perception of the world around us.\\n[34:20] Fragmentation of the value structure necessarily leads to an increased level of constant anxiety in all experience.\\n[36:30] What parts of modern society are contributing to the integrity of consciousness, and what things are degrading that. A hatred for real success and striving for personal gain will tear us apart if left unchecked.\\n[43:30] There is no doubt that economic exploitation occurs and that some wealth is gained in an unethical manner - but that is not the rule.\\n[45:45] On the importance of beauty in personal experiences as well as the collective human experience.\\n[51:00] Differences between Dostoevsky and Nietzsche; closeness to the ideal of beauty\\n[56:30] The complexity of the language of Beyond Order: 12 More Rules for Life. What is Jordan's process for increasing precision in writing and speech? \\n[1:03:30] The divinity of the true word and the way this has been translated through Jordan’s book Beyond Order. Peterson's philosophy behind good writing and text structure of a truly complete work.\\n[1:13:40] Mikhaila Peterson’s strength in the face of a great deal of suffering in her life. How wonderful it is to see her succeeding in personal endeavors like her podcast.\\n[1:20:15] Fostering children’s individual growth and love of learning.\\n[1:32:00] Wrapping up \\n\\n// SUPPORT THIS CHANNEL //\\nNewsletter: https://linktr.ee/DrJordanBPeterson\\nDonations: https://jordanbpeterson.com/donate\\n\\n// COURSES //\\nDiscovering Personality: https://jordanbpeterson.com/personality\\nSelf Authoring Suite: https://selfauthoring.com\\nUnderstand Myself (personality test): https://understandmyself.com\\n\\n// BOOKS //\\nBeyond Order: 12 More Rules for Life: https://jordanbpeterson.com/Beyond-Order\\n12 Rules for Life: An Antidote to Chaos: https://jordanbpeterson.com/12-rules-for-life\\nMaps of Meaning: The Architecture of Belief: https://jordanbpeterson.com/maps-of-meaning\\n\\n// LINKS //\\nWebsite: https://jordanbpeterson.com\\nEvents: https://jordanbpeterson.com/events\\nBlog: https://jordanbpeterson.com/blog\\nPodcast: https://jordanbpeterson.com/podcast\\n\\n// SOCIAL //\\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/jordanbpeterson\\nInstagram: https://instagram.com/jordan.b.peterson\\nFacebook: https://facebook.com/drjordanpeterson\\n\\n// SPONSORS //\\nFor Advertising Inquiries, visit: \\nhttps://advertisecast.com/TheJordanBPetersonPodcast","7":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Cn_lucBscH4/default.jpg","8":"120","9":"90","10":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Cn_lucBscH4/mqdefault.jpg","11":"320","12":"180","13":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Cn_lucBscH4/hqdefault.jpg","14":"480","15":"360","16":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Cn_lucBscH4/sddefault.jpg","17":"640","18":"480","19":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Cn_lucBscH4/maxresdefault.jpg","20":"1280","21":"720","22":"Jordan B Peterson","23":"none","24":"2022-01-13T19:36:22Z"},{"1":"1Gp7xNnW5n8","2":"vDNSnMTem98","3":"2021-04-26T15:49:54Z","4":"UCL_f53ZEJxp8TtlOkHwMV9Q","5":"Is Everything Better Than We Think? | Bjorn Lomborg - Jordan B Peterson Podcast S4 (2022):  E16","6":"Bjorn Lomborg's newest book \"False Alarm\" available here: https://www.amazon.com/False-Alarm-Climate-Change-Trillions/dp/1541647467\\n\\nThis episode was recorded on January 21, 2021.\\n\\nDr. Bjorn Lomborg and I discuss a variety of topics in the realm of climate change and worldwide problems.

Governments are being forced to press their citizens, straining already fragile economic and agricultural systems, in order to appease a globalist utopian vision. Bjørn Lomborg and Ralph Schoellhammer sit down with Dr Jordan B Peterson to discuss the faults in this plan, and the people who are suffering because of it.\\n\\nBjørn Lomborg is a Danish author, having written numerous books on climate change such as “False Alarm,” “The Skeptical Environmentalist,” and “How to Spend $75 Billion to Make the World a Better Place.” He is the president of the think tank Copenhagen Consensus Center that focuses on doing the most good, for the most people, with increasingly limited budgets. Previously, Lomborg was the director of the Danish government's Environmental Assessment Institute.\\n\\nRalph Schoellhammer is a scholar and journalist operating in Europe who has diligently covered overlooked stories such as the Dutch Farmers Protest.

The driver had his phone hooked up through the stereo and was pumping out an episode through the car speakers — loudly, as if looking to convert a captive audience.\\n\\n“Do you like Kyle Kulinski?”\\n\\nThe driver, Ahmed, was a recent immigrant and apparently a die-hard fan of Secular Talk, the political talk show that Kulinski broadcasts on YouTube. I told him, yes, in fact. I do like Kulinski, had come across his show several years ago, and, all things considered, he seemed pretty good.\\n\\n“He understands what we’re up against,” Ahmed said. “Like Bernie.”\\n\\nBut I was surprised to hear Kulinski’s name mentioned in the same breath as Bernie Sanders, particularly with such adoration. Because what I did remember about Kulinski’s show struck me as mostly capital-P “progressive” takes on the news — the left wing of the Netroots crowd more than the democratic socialism Sanders has popularized.\\n\\nIt’s an impression that wasn’t entirely incorrect.\\n\\n“I have no time for philosophical, airy bullshit,” Kulinski tells me from his home in Westchester, New York. “I don’t want to hear about Lenin. I don’t want to hear about Marx. I just want a super plainspoken, straightforward agenda with a straightforward way of selling it.”\\n\\nWith over 800,000 subscribers and nearly 670 million total views on YouTube, selling a progressive agenda is clearly something Kulinski knows how to do — even Democracy Now, the long-standing flagship of progressive media, cannot match his reach on the platform. Chapo Trap House can certainly boast a wildly devoted fan base (and a not insignificant degree of media influence), but their audience is roughly half the size of Kulinski’s.\\n\\nWhile Secular Talk might be more likely to be looped in with the progressive networks around Air America and Pacifica alums like Sam Seder than the more resolutely socialist world, Kulinski’s fiery rhetoric, razor-sharp class instincts, and knack for withering takedowns sets him apart from his peers. Judging by his rhetoric alone, he’s closer to a Eugene Debs than a Chris Hayes.\\n\\nBut unlike Hayes, Amy Goodman, or his friend Cenk Uygur of The Young Turks — who began airing Secular Talk on his web network seven years ago — the thirty-two-year-old Kulinski is virtually invisible in the mainstream media. Despite his enormous fan base, his show has never once been mentioned in the obligatory trend pieces on “the Millennial Left” pumped out by the prestige media. Nor has Kulinski’s name ever popped up at all in the New York Times, Vox, the New Yorker, New York Magazine, or the Washington Post, despite his leading role in cofounding Justice Democrats, the organization widely credited with sweeping Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and the rest of “the Squad” to power.\\n\\nJust last week, his Wikipedia page was deleted. The reason? “There is very simply no [reliable source] coverage of this person,” according to one moderator. In new media, he’s king — the Sean Hannity of the Berniecrat left. In old media, he’s nobody.\\n\\nI suspect there are a few reasons for that. There is nothing “cool” about Kulinski’s show. (As a friend put it, “‘Welcome to Secular Talk’ sounds like something you’d hear on Egyptian radio.”) His no-nonsense social-democratic politics won’t get him much cred with the Full Communism crowd. He records his show not in Brooklyn or Los Angeles, but in a studio he built himself in his modest Westchester home. His hair is too groomed and his taste in clothes too preppy to qualify as “Dirtbag Left.” Nor has he ever attended an n+1 release party. “Not only have I not attended one,” he says, “I have no idea what that means.”\\n\\nAnd yet he’s astonishingly plugged-in for a young man in the suburbs. Wondering how Sanders ended up on the Joe Rogan Experience? Kulinski, a frequent guest on Rogan’s wildly popular show, introduced them. “You make the most sense to me,” Rogan told Kulinski on a recent episode. “You’re a normal person.”\\n\\nMuch like Sanders himself, Kulinski’s show has a massive audience that just doesn’t compute with our media’s understanding of “what the kids want” or even “what the left-wing kids want.”\\n\\nIt’s probably for the best — the very woke and very WASP-ish decorum haunting much of the media world is nowhere to be found in Secular Talk. “Corporate Democrats over-focus on identity as a trick to divert you from the issues that unite us all — class issues,” he said on a recent episode. “That Raytheon decided they don’t hate gays or trans people — frankly, I don’t really give a shit what their take on that is...\"\\n\\nRead More Here!:\\nhttps://jacobinmag.com/2020/03/kyle-kulinski-bernie-bros-secular-talk-joe-rogan-youtube\\n\\n#KyleKulinski #SecularTalk","7":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/F0EFlYV4b4M/default.jpg","8":"120","9":"90","10":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/F0EFlYV4b4M/mqdefault.jpg","11":"320","12":"180","13":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/F0EFlYV4b4M/hqdefault.jpg","14":"480","15":"360","16":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/F0EFlYV4b4M/sddefault.jpg","17":"640","18":"480","19":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/F0EFlYV4b4M/maxresdefault.jpg","20":"1280","21":"720","22":"Secular Talk","23":"none","24":"2022-02-09T20:02:56Z"},{"1":"1Gp7xNnW5n8","2":"BtkwF5qA6uE","3":"2018-08-30T19:07:03Z","4":"UCL_f53ZEJxp8TtlOkHwMV9Q","5":"AB Harris/Weinstein/Peterson Discussion: Vancouver","6":"Harris/Weinstein/Peterson: Discussion 02: Vancouver\\n\\nThis is the second video of the four-part debate that Sam Harris and I undertook in June 2018. \\n\\nSam and I met twice in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada, with Bret Weinstein moderating, for a third time in Dublin, Ireland, and for a fourth and final time in London, England.

He believes (1) that our ethical systems should or even must be grounded in something other than arbitrary revelation or opinion; (2) that the world of facts can and should provide that grounding; and (3) that the grounding of values in fact can occur in the absence of much perceptual or cognitive intermediation. \\nI agree with him with regard to point (1) but not point (2) and (3). I won’t present any of my argument here, however, because Sam isn’t here to respond, as he is in the videos. \\n\\nI have also written three blog posts on the Harris/Peterson discussions, here:\\n\\n1. https://jordanbpeterson.com/philosophy/facts-and-values-science-and-religion-notes-on-the-sam-harris-discussions-part-i/\\n\\n2. https://jordanbpeterson.com/philosophy/facts-from-values-not-without-an-intermediary-notes-on-the-sam-harris-discussions-part-ii/\\n\\n3. TBA\\n\\nA note on the release of the videos, and their delay: Any event of this scale occurs because of the collaboration of many people, including, in this case. Travis Pangburn and his staff at Pangburn Philosophy, who organized and promoted the four-part debate series, and who incurred substantial financial and reputational risk in doing so (as nothing like this has been attempted before at this scale). None of us were sure at the outset whether Sam and I would manage a useful discussion, let alone four of them, or whether there would be a positive public response. In consequence, we didn’t spend much time before the debate series thinking about release (or formatting/editing) of video or audio recording. Since the events went well, however – appearing both productive and well-received publicly – we decided to move ahead with the production and release of the recordings. The team at Pangburn Philosophy completed the editing, in consequence. Sam and I agreed to allow the initial release behind Travis’s Patreon paywall, for a two-week period, after which we would post the videos for full public access on our respective video platforms, and release the audio in podcast form. The team at Pangburn Philosophy plans to use some substantial portion of what was raised through Patreon subscription for multi-language translation of their previously produced and future content (including these four debates). \\n\\n--- SUPPORT THIS CHANNEL ---\\n\\nDirect Support: https://www.jordanbpeterson.com/donate\\nMerchandise: https://teespring.com/stores/jordanbpeterson\\n\\n--- BOOKS ---\\n\\n12 Rules for Life: An Antidote to Chaos: https://jordanbpeterson.com/12-rules-for-life/\\nMaps of Meaning: The Architecture of Belief: https://jordanbpeterson.com/maps-of-meaning/\\n\\n--- LINKS ---\\n\\nWebsite: https://jordanbpeterson.com/\\n12 Rules for Life Tour: https://jordanbpeterson.com/events/\\nBlog: https://jordanbpeterson.com/blog/\\nPodcast: https://jordanbpeterson.com/podcast/\\nReading List: https://jordanbpeterson.com/great-books/\\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/jordanbpeterson\\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/jordan.b.peterson/\\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/drjordanpeterson\\n\\n--- PRODUCTS ---\\n\\nPersonality Course: https://www.jordanbpeterson.com/personality\\nSelf Authoring Suite: https://selfauthoring.com/\\nUnderstand Myself personality test: https://understandmyself.com/\\nMerchandise: https://teespring.com/stores/jordanbpeterson","7":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/BtkwF5qA6uE/default.jpg","8":"120","9":"90","10":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/BtkwF5qA6uE/mqdefault.jpg","11":"320","12":"180","13":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/BtkwF5qA6uE/hqdefault.jpg","14":"480","15":"360","16":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/BtkwF5qA6uE/sddefault.jpg","17":"640","18":"480","19":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/BtkwF5qA6uE/maxresdefault.jpg","20":"1280","21":"720","22":"Jordan B Peterson","23":"none","24":"2018-08-30T19:07:03Z"},{"1":"1Gp7xNnW5n8","2":"PY4sShDt9to","3":"2017-09-03T15:20:56Z","4":"UCL_f53ZEJxp8TtlOkHwMV9Q","5":"The Neuroscience of Intelligence: Dr. Richard Haier","6":"There is almost nothing more important to understand about people than intelligence. It can be measured more accurately than anything else in the social sciences. It differs tremendously and importantly between individuals. It is the single most important determinant of life success. It's very existence, however, remains subject to substantive debate, most of it highly politicized. \\n\\nDr. Richard Haier has recently written a major book on the topic, The Neuroscience of Intelligence (http://amzn.to/2em55A9), summarized in the following manner: \"This book introduces new and provocative neuroscience research that advances our understanding of intelligence and the brain. Compelling evidence shows that genetics plays a more important role than environment as intelligence develops from childhood, and that intelligence test scores correspond strongly to specific features of the brain assessed with neuroimaging. In understandable language, Richard J. Haier explains cutting-edge techniques based on genetics, DNA, and imaging of brain connectivity and function.

Unfortunately, for many reasons, this presumption is simply incorrect. In fact, the reverse is true, insofar as social engineering is concerned: the personality and other differences between men and women MAXIMIZES instead of minimizing in exactly those societies that have moved closest to the egalitarian ideal (the Scandinavian countries). This is because those countries have eradicated most of the environmentally-produced variation in these traits, leaving only those that are genetic to manifest themselves.
